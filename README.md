# Hi there!
Welcome to my GitHub!

I am currently a UniMelb student studying Finance and Computer Science.

Due to <b><u> University Policy </u> </b> I am unable to upload some of my projects done at University here.
<br>
I have done projects such as:
<ol>
  <li> Binary Search Tree dictionary (C) - Created a BST dictionary from data file, duplicates handles through linked lists and performed an analysis on it's performace with respect to Big(O) </li>
  <li> Pacman AI (C) - Breadth and Depth first search implementations combined with simulating n future states of the game to see what the best possible next move would be based on maximum and average scores </li>
  <li> Shadow Build minigame (Java) - Can create different units, and mine resources in order to mine "unobtanium", goal is to mine it as efficiently as possible </li>
  <li> Big Data project (Python, SQL) - Queried, wrangled, refined and completed data, formed an object oriented software system to divide UniMelb subject usage data by faculties, and reported time-series visualisations to show how academics used Learning Management Systems for their subjects over time </li>
    
</ol>
</br>
I am very happy to provide you access to any of these files if you are interested (if you are an employer, or non-current UniMelb student), but I am unable to make them public. Please shoot me an email at singhsidak@ymail.com for access.

Cheers!
Sidak
